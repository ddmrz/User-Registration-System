# User Registration System
A basic user registration system.

## Features
* Allows user registration
* Login/logout system
* Cookie-based authentication
* Realtime AJAX 'username taken' error notification

## To Do
* Incorporate more error checking
* Improve security
* E-Mail verification when registering
* Add a control panel to manage users

## Note
  This project is only a tech demo of sorts, as such the level of security is very low. Passwords are only stored under the MD5 algorithm, which is unsecure. Use at your own risk.
